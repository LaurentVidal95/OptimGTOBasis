Small Julia code to test the optimization of gaussian basis sets, as described in [CDKV][^1], on diatomic systems. The reference data used for optimization are obtained with the finite element code [Helfem](https://github.com/susilehtola/HelFEM).

# Requirements:
Julia 1.8 and above. Tested on Julia 1.9.
